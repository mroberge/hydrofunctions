    "# Requesting Peak Discharges\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to request a list of each year's largest flood using the USGS's Peak Discharge service. This \n",
    "list of annual peak discharges is perfect for doing a flood frequency analysis: you can calculate recurrence intervals and plot a flood frequency graph using these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data provided by the USGS peak service are based on a 'water year', which starts on October 1st and ends in the last moments of September. This unusual definition for the start of the year is standard practice in US hydrology: September/October often marks the lowest flows of the year for much of the country, so it is less likely that there will be a large flood that spans the end of one year and continues on into the new year. As an example of the problems that we are trying to avoid by using a 'water year', imagine the largest flood in a decade peaking in the last days of December. As the water slowly receeds, \n",
    "it may still be quite high on January 1st. The tail end of last year's flood may well be the highest discharge of the whole next year! This would interfere with our statistical assumptions about each flood event. By setting the end of the year/start of the year to the low-flow season, we mostly avoid double-counting floods without any extra processing. "

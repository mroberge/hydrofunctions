install:
  # Travis has a pre-installed copy of numpy in their Python 3.5 & 3.6
  # environments, but not for Python 3.4. The 3.5 & 3.6 builds took 70 seconds,
  # but it could take 9 minutes to build numpy & pandas. SciPy failed.

  # Solution #1 was to install miniconda and then use conda.
  # Solution #2 was to cache a successful build and use that later. https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/

  # My solution: upgrade pip and then install some of the more difficult
  # packages from binary wheels. my 3.4 build times dropped to seven minutes by
  # doing this for numpy and scipy; Adding the rest dropped it to 1 minute!

  # the "--only-binary" option was added in pip 7 back in 2015; still to be safe, upgrade pip
  - pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
  - pip install --only-binary=numpy,scipy,pandas,Ipython,matplotlib numpy scipy pandas ipython matplotlib

  # Install codecov so I can use it (and coverage.py) to run setup.py
  # However, keep codecov in setup.py so that it gets installed for local usage too.
  - pip install codecov

script:
  # Only run the coverage report for one build; all other builds just run test.
  - if [[ $TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION == 3.6 ]]; then export RUN_COVERAGE=1; fi
  - if [[ $TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION == 3.6 ]]; then coverage run --branch --source hydrofunctions setup.py test; fi
  - if [[ $TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION != 3.6 ]]; then python setup.py test; fi

after_success:
  # Only run codecov if we collected stats and set the coverage flag.

    """Creates a flow duration chart from a dataframe of discharges.

    Args:
        Qdf (dataframe): a dataframe of discharge values.

            * Values should be arranged in columns
            * No sorting necessary
            * Rows do not need an index
            * If more than one column, each column will be added as a\
                separate color to the chart.
            * Only include columns with discharge values; no metadata

        xscale (str, 'logit' | 'linear'): Type of x scale for plotting probabilities
            default is 'logit', so that each standard deviation is nearly the
            same distance on the x scale. 'linear' is the other option.

        yscale (str, 'log' | 'linear'): The type of y scale for plotting discharge.
            Default is 'log'.

        ylabel (`str`, default `'Stream Discharge (ft³/s)'`): The label for the Y axis.

        xlabel (not implemented)

        symbol (str, '.' | ','): formatting symbol for points.

            * point: '.' (default)
            * pixel point: ','
            * circle: 'o'
            * triangle up: '^'

            See https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html for full list of
            point formatters.

        legend (`bool`, default `True`): Whether the legend should be plotted.

        legend_loc (`str`, default `best`): the location of the legend.

            * 'best': Automatically choose the option below with the least overlap.
            * 'upper left', 'upper right', 'lower left', 'lower right': place the legend at the corresponding corner of the axes/figure.
            * 'upper center', 'lower center', 'center left', 'center right': place the legend at the center of the corresponding edge of the axes/figure.
            * 'center': place the legend at the center of the axes/figure.
            * The location can also be a 2-tuple giving the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the legend in axes coordinates.

        title (`str`, default ''): Text to use as a figure title. If no text
            is provided, no title will be created (default).

    Returns:
        fig, ax (`matplotlib.figure.Figure`, `matplotlib.axes.Axes`):
            Returns a tuple that includes a matplotlib 'figure' and 'axes'. The figure
            is a container with all of the drawing inside of it; the axes are an array
            of matplotlib charts. Together, they will plot immediately in a Jupyter
            notebook if the command `%matplotlib inline` was previously issued.
            The figure and axes may be altered after they are returned.

    """Creates a chart to illustrate annual and diurnal cycles.

    This chart will use the pandas groupby method to plot the mean and median
    values for a time-indexed dataframe. It helps you identify diurnal patterns
    by plotting the mean and median values over 24 hours for a diurnal pattern,
    and over a year for annual patterns.

    This function will also use the 'compare' argument to create a series of
    charts to compare how well these cycles appear in different groups. For
    example, is the diurnal cycle more visible in December versus June? In this
    case, you would use::

        hf.cycleplot(myDataFrame, cycle='diurnal', compare = 'month')

    This will produce twelve charts, each covering 24 hours. A line will
    represent the mean values over 24 hours, another line represents the
    median, and two grey stripes represent the 0.4 to 0.6 quantile, and the
    0.2 to 0.8 quantile range.

    Args:
        Qseries (series): a Pandas series of discharge values.

            * Values should be arranged in columns
            * Should use a dateTimeIndex

        cycle (str): The period of the cycle to be illustrated, along with the
            method for binning. The options are:

            * diurnal (default): plots the values for a 24 hour cycle.
            * diurnal-smallest: uses the smallest increment of time \
            available to bin the time units for a 24 hour cycle.
            * diurnal-hour: uses hours to bin measurements for a 24-hour \
            cycle.
            * annual: plots values into a 365 day cycle.
            * annual-day: the annual cycle using 365 day-long bins.
            * annual-week: the annual cycle using 52 week-long bins.
            * annual-month: the annual cycle using 12 month-long bins.
            * weekly: a 7-day cycle using seven 24-hour long bins. Note \
            that unlike the others, this is not a natural cycle, and is \
            likely has anthropogenic origins.

        compare (str): The system for splitting the data into
            groups for a set of comparison charts.

            * None (default): No comparison will be made; only one chart.
            * month: twelve plots will be produced, one for each month.
            * weekday: seven plots will be produced, one for each day of \
            the week.
            * weekend: two plots will be produced, one for the five weekdays, \
            one for Saturday and Sunday.
            * night: two plots will be produced, one for night (6pm to 6am), \
            one for day (6am to 6pm).

        y_label (str): The label for the y axis.

        legend (bool): default True. Whether the legend should be plotted.

        legend_loc (str): default is 'best'. The location of the legend.

            * 'best': Automatically choose the option below with the least overlap.
            * 'upper left', 'upper right', 'lower left', 'lower right': place the legend at the corresponding corner of the axes/figure.
            * 'upper center', 'lower center', 'center left', 'center right': place the legend at the center of the corresponding edge of the axes/figure.
            * 'center': place the legend at the center of the axes/figure.
            * The location can also be a 2-tuple giving the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the legend in axes coordinates.

        title (str): default is ''. Text to use as a figure title. If no text
            is provided, no title will be created (default).

    Returns:
        fig, ax (matplotlib.figure.Figure, matplotlib.axes.Axes):
            Returns a tuple that includes a matplotlib 'figure' and 'axes'. The figure
            is a container with all of the drawing inside of it; the axes are an array
            of matplotlib charts. Together, they will plot immediately in a Jupyter
            notebook if the command `%matplotlib inline` was previously issued.
            The figure and axes may be altered after they are returned.
